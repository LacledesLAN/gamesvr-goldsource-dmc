![Laclede's LAN Deathmatch Classic Freeplay Dedicated Server in Docker](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LacledesLAN/gamesvr-goldsource-dmc/master/.misc/banner-goldsource-dmc.png?token=AMNjdgmBT2XZqn2seZ8MKbPJ3A7Ni3-Eks5bwqBPwA%3D%3D "Laclede's LAN Deathmatch Classic Freeplay Dedicated Server in Docker")

Deathmatch Classic was conceived by Valve as a tribute to id Software, and is essentially a remake of the multiplayer component of id's Quake. The gameplay is similar to Quake Deathmatch, with essentially the same weapons (except the weapon for mel√©e combat, which is Half-Life's trademark crowbar instead of the original axe). DMC also imitates Quake's physics, which allows an advanced player to gain a lot of extra speed or jump very high by using a number of movement skills such as bunny hopping and rocket jumping.

## Getting Started with Game Servers in Docker

[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) is an open-source project that bundles applications into lightweight, portable, self-sufficient containers. For a crash course on running Dockerized game servers check out [Using Docker for Game Servers](https://github.com/LacledesLAN/README.1ST/blob/master/GameServers/DockerAndGameServers.md). For tips, tricks, and recommended tools for working with Laclede's LAN Dockerized game server repos see the guide for [Working with our Game Server Repos](https://github.com/LacledesLAN/README.1ST/blob/master/GameServers/WorkingWithOurRepos.md). You can also browse all of our other Dockerized game servers: [Laclede's LAN Game Servers Directory](https://github.com/LacledesLAN/README.1ST/tree/master/GameServers).
